# sublime-projects

Sublime Text project files for various frameworks.

## Instructions

Just copy the `[framework].sublime-project` file to your project and rename it for your project, eg: `rails.sublime-project` to `my-rails-project.sublime-project`. Every project includes `.` as default project path.
